            <h3>Education & Literacy</h3>
            <br>
            <p>The introduction of free primary education has led to an increase in the number of children accessing primary education-40% of children who complete primary school do not transition to high school due to few spaces in high school and lack of school fees. Out of those who transition to high school only 20% are admitted into college.
SADO identifies orphans and vulnerable children who are unable to get education due to lack of school fees. We give children the skills and confidence to pursue education and careers henceforth, escape extreme poverty and be able to support families and be self-reliant. Our holistic approach to education emphasize the development of every person’s intellectual, emotional, social, physical, artistic, creative and spiritual potentials. We seek to engage students in the teaching/learning process and encourage personal and collective responsibility. We pursue the poor and marginalized and empower the youth by expanding their perspective and making them aware of life’s possibilities.
We currently run 3 programs to helping learners to achieve their potential</p>

                Sustainable Energy
            
SADO works towards increasing access to clean and affordable energy for the increasingly growing rural populations, providing sustained partnership to individuals, NGOs and renewable energy entrepreneurs in combating energy poverty, climate change and environmental protection.
Human activity is overloading our atmosphere with carbon dioxide and other global warming emissions, which trap heat, steadily drive up the planet’s temperature, and create significant and harmful impacts on our health, our environment, and our climate.
SADO has put together initiatives and campaigns that address on recurrent emerging issues that negatively impact the environment and the globe as a whole. 
SADOs aims to provide substantial benefits associated with these energy technologies include:
a) Improved public health and environmental quality
b) A vast and inexhaustible energy supply
c) Job creation and other economic benefits
d)  Stable energy prices
e)  A more reliable and resilient global energy system

Climate Change
Forests play a significant role in providing abundant supplies of clean water. Our forests clean our air and fight climate change. They provide habitat for threatened and endangered wildlife.
But just as we need forests, our forests need us. Natural disasters such as insect and disease outbreaks have deforested millions of acres. With support from mindful individuals, small businesses, corporations and foundations, SADO is making a difference working closely with our supporters.
SADO offers cost-effective corporate partnerships that contribute to corporate social responsibility goals and offer opportunities for consumer engagement. We want to help tell your sustainability story. 
You can generate countless benefits for your forests, communities, and the globe as a whole through the simple act of planting a tree! You can give a Gift of Trees or make a general donation to plant trees.

            <h3>Social Economic Empowerment</h3>
            <p>
                Sustainable Energy
            
Many developing countries and economies, particularly those with large rural communities, suffer from inadequate access to food and lack of employment. The problem is compounded by the dependence on outdated and inefficient technologies leading to poor productivity and slow economic growth. Agriculture-based industrial products account for half of all exports from developing countries, yet only 30 per cent of those exports involve processed goods compared to a figure of 98 per cent in the developed world.
SADO promotes investment in agribusiness and value chain development; builds partnerships and linkages with strategic financing institutions,organizes various community forums and expert group meetings in related fields..

            <p>
                Culture & Sports
        Sports is a powerful social connector. It brings people together, expands and strengthens social ties and networks. It's SADO's initiative to link people to resources and provide them with a sense of belonging.

            <p class="text-center" style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 2.2em"> 
                
                SADO Foundation <br> has its genesis at the grassroots of the community. From a small village in Kisii County, Kenya and Mathare slum village in the heart of Nairobi City, an idea was hatched by a small number of men and women to better their lives. As the needs of the members grew, so was the need to be more visionary. Due to increase demand for better services and more outreaches, SADO, a community based organization was formed in 2016. This CBO was mandated to better the livelihood of not only the registered members but also the community around it. Poverty had been identified as a saboteur to development, orphans are increasingly becoming a concern and widows are also increasing in number due to HIV prevalence.
                Disability has seen in part of the society has not been treated as a normal phenomenon within the society thus most disable childrens’ have not been given the privileges to attend school and even play as per there age mates.
                The organization has brought hope to the disable families by ensuring that they are recognized within their communities by ensuring that they attend school and participate in key activities within the society.
                Poverty coupled with orphan and increased number of widows has affected the level of literacy and as seen cases of increased adolescents’ pregnancy, child headed families and abandonment of children that has led to upsurge in the number of street children’s.
                SADO embraced these vulnerable groups and mobilized the community to help alleviate the wanton suffering. School going children had little or no educational support, widows had poor shelter, some had none at all and food was scarce to many of this group. SADO provided basic needs for poor families, school uniform for needy orphans and school fees for destitute children.
